Exercises for FastAI v2


## Setup
These notebooks are intended for fast and hassle-free pratice. I decided to use Colab to keep the setup minimum. Still, there are a few setps you need to follow.

To start using colab notebooks, go <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/"> here </a>.

You should see a window like this (if not, click on "file -> Open Notebook") :

<img src='colab_open.png' width='80%' />

Please click on the "Github" Tab:

<img src='colab_github1.png' width='80%' />

Now, enter "bdubreu" in the search bar and press enter (or click the magnifying glass):

<img src='colab_github2.png' width='80%' />

You should see all the notebooks appearing. Select one, open it and you're good to go ;)
